REQUIREMENTS:

• Create a new local React project using Create React App.

• Begin by breaking the UI into separate sections, and creating static, stateless components for each piece.

• You should be able to see a complete static version of your user interface before working on the interactivity.

• Add state to your components where necessary to store information about the current progress through the game.

• You might want to think about storing some or all of the following:
  • The current number which the user is trying to guess.
  • The user's most recent guess.
  • A history of the user's guesses.
  • The feedback currently being displayed to the user.
  • The different options for feedback that the user can be given.
  
• Add interactivity so your components respond to the user making a guess, and update the state accordingly.
